# VUE Typescript Starter

Basically this App has three components: AppHeader, AppFooter, HelloWorld (for testing)
and two views: Home + About.

In `.env` is the title define - check it out.

'Click' modifies and displays text in the lower right

The cat on the top right is add statically, the Lamborghini is added dynamically in the component.
